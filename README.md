# Twitter Sentiment Analysis
## Description
The project aims to create a efficient text recognition model developed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) that classifies a certain piece of text as positive or negative on basis of the sentiment experssed by the sentence.
## Training Dataset
The NLP model is trained on a large [Twitter dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140) available on Kaggle consisting of 1.6m training examples which makes it experienced enough to further make wise decisions.
## Future Enhancements
I am thinking to develop a proper user interface to try it out more conveniently as soon as possible.
